# Compiler Project

Name: Giullya Santos & Dilly Jacques

To compile & run this code, first download the input files to the same directory.
Use "gcc hw4compiler.c" to generate a program file from the .c file.
You can now run the program while passing in your input file with this 
command: "./a.out FILENAME.txt"

OBS: Correctly formatted inputs will display the source, a message saying it's 
correct and the assembly code. Inputs with an error will display the same, but instead
of a message saying it's correct, it will tell you the error and will not display
the assembly code as it could not be generated. elf.txt files are only generated for correctly
formatted inputs
